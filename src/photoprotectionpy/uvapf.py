    """
    Calculate initial UVA protection factor before 
    UV exposure (UVA-PF<sub>0<sub>) or UVA protection factor 
    after UV exposure (UVA-PF).

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : list, pandas.DataFrame or numpy.array
        Each column of the array is a treatment, where 
        rows correspond to each read measured from 290 
        to 400 nm (dλ=1). Use mean absorbance before UV 
        absorbance for UVA-PF<sub>0<sub> and mean absorbanve 
        after UV exposure for UVA-PF.
    C : float
        Coefficient of adjustment "C".
    integration : string
        Choose between "trapz" (default)
        or "simpson"
     batch : boolean
         By default False. If true, will determine C or SPF of 
         all data samples against a single target SPF or an
         already calcualted C value.
         
    Returns
    -------
    UVA-PF<sub>0<sub> or UVA-PF : float
