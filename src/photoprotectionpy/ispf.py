    Determine initial calculated *in vitro* SPF

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : list, pandas.DataFrame or numpy.array
        Each column of the array is a treatment, where rows correspond 
        to each read measured from 290 to 400 nm (dλ=1). 
    integration : string
        Choose between "trapz" (default)
        or "simpson"
        
    Returns
    -------
    initial SPF : list containing floats
        Returns calculated *in vitro* SPF.
